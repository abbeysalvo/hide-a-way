      "Made from finger-jointed pine, paint grade is the lowest grade we carry. Paint grade comes primed white from the manufacturer and has some imperfections. Less dense than the other woods we provide, paint grade scratches and dents easily. Units shipped unfinished may need more coats of primer as the joints are glued and sanded smooth which does remove some of the primer. We do not apply a primer for DIY finishes.",

      "Sometimes referred to as Knotty Alder is a relative of Birch*. Alder has a reddish-brown tint with a fairly straight grain pattern. Knots and checks are common with Alder, so people looking for a rustic looking door choose Alder. Alder, because of the rustic knotty look, doesn't accept paint all that well but does look very good stained and can be clear coated.",

      "Maple is commonly known for two different types, Soft or Hard Maple, we use soft maple because it is readily available and is easier to work with than hard maple. Maple has smooth, tight grain patterns making it excellent for painting. Maple is very strong and doesn't dent or scratch as easy as pine or poplar. Maple has fine grain patterns and even colors throughout making it perfect for woodworking projects & cabinet making. Maple takes stain extremely well making it perfect to stain. Maple can be stained to look like other more expensive wood like hickory, walnut, or cherry. Maple can also be painted.",
